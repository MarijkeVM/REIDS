# The REIDS Model

* Run REIDS model to obtain the parameter estimates. This can be done item by item (see SingleItems) or in parallel (see Parallel).

* Obtain a dataframe with the statistics for every probe set joined with junction information with  REIDS_Identification.R
  A necessary file is a file linking the junctions and the probe sets. This is the hta1.r1.ass file. The file is rather large and was not   uploaded. Contact me if interested.

* Rank the identified probe sets based on the junction information with REIDS_Ranking.R
