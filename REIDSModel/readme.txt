1) Run REIDS model to obtain the parameter estimates. This can be done item by item (see SingleItems) or in parallel (see Parallel).

2) Obtain a dataframe with the statistics for every probe set joined with junction information with  REIDS_Identification.R
   A necessary file is a file linking the junctions and the probe sets. This is the hta1.r1.ass file. The file is rather large and was not    uploaded. Contact me if interested.

3) Rank the identified probe sets based on the junction information with .R
