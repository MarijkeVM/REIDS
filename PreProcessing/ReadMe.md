# Preprocessing

The folder structure of the preprocessing folder is important for the aroma.affymetrix R package. Therefore, include the .cdf in annotationData/chipTypes/hjay and the .CEL files in rawData/HTA_RASA/hjay. The .cdf and .CEL files are not included due to their size. Please feel free to contact me if interested.

The HTA_PreProcessing.R file can be run in R after installing the aroma.affymetrix package.
